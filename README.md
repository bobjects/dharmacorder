### The Dharmacorder

The Dharmacorder is a Raspberry Pi-based embedded system that records digital audio, stores it, and uploads it to a remote server for editing and publication as podcast episodes.

Bob Hartwig originally developed The Dharmacorder for recording audio for [The Blue Lotus Temple Podcast](https://www.bluelotustemple.org/podcast/) from the temple's sound board.

More docs coming soon.
